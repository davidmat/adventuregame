# Goal of the Game

There is a treasure hidden in the attic, but you will need to find your way through the house. Work your way up to the attic by gathering the right items in your backpack.

Also, beware of the Chuck. Chuck Norris, that is.
(Yes, Chuck Norris was a meme when this game was written).
